## üî¨ Description

This repository contains Mathematica code and supplementary files for the article  
**‚ÄúOld Quantum Mechanics by Bohr and Sommerfeld from a Modern Perspective.‚Äù**  
The project revisits the Bohr model and its extension by Sommerfeld from a modern mathematical viewpoint. It emphasizes semiclassical approximations (WKB), relativistic corrections, and connections to the Schr√∂dinger and Dirac equations.

The included Mathematica notebook performs symbolic computations that derive and expand upon several equations presented in the paper, such as the fine-structure formula, Sommerfeld-type integrals, and quantization rules.
